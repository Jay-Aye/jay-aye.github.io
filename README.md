# SCOPE OF WORKS

" As an aspiring developer, it is important to be able to demonstrate your abilities to prospective employers. A great way to do this is to design, develop and deploy a website that showcases your talent, abilities and coding experience. "

Design, Develop, Publish and Present a website in 2 weeks.

# WHAT I WANT OUT OF THIS PROJECT

* Learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS so later I can build a portfolio website to showcase to future employers
* Create a website that I am proud of that I can use as "My first Website" as a project piece for my portfolio website.
* Create a website that has a strong base of responsivness across multiple platforms.

Starting this project I have no experience in HTML or CSS so I have to understand I won't be able to create a big flashy website and it will be a learn as I go.

# PLANNING

With 2 weeks to complete this project I feel that to get the most out of this website I should work on HTML and CSS foundations as much as possible.  I decided to spend half of my allocated time completeing tutorials and reading text materials. 1 day will be spent on the design and layout of the website.  1 day will be spent on documentation and the remaining time will be spent on coding my website.

# LEARNING

I completed codeacademy's online tutorial in HTML and CSS.  Read through countless online resources that ranged from website design, clean coding in HTML and CSS and responsiveness.  I looked into different frameworks including Bootstrap.

This gave me a really strong foundation in HTML and CSS and what is possible in the creation of a website.

# DESIGN

* **AUDIENCE**

This is my first ever website.  I want to use this as a project piece for a furture portfolio website.  Therefore my audience for this project is my class mates and teachers.  It will also be viewed on my portfolio so possible new employers might look at it.

* **INSPIRATION**

I loved the look of the mirrors on the wall and thought it looked so clean and elegant.  I thought maybe overlaying it over a picture as a cutout would be nice.
Then I found the picture of Melbourne from Southbank and just loved every element of it.  It was so dark and mysterious.
With that I felt that I had my attention grabbing section of the website.

* **DESIGN DECISIONS**

**HTML and CSS only -**  Not utilise any libraries or frameworks because I feel like I would be cutting corners in my learning.
**Keep it simple (KISS)-**  I want to have one section of the website that is eye catching and engaging. I want the rest of the website to be fairly simple.
**Menus -** I want to have a top fixed menu for navigation across the website.  It will still look good on either mobile or desktop and keep the same style over both.
**Contact info -** I want the contact information to be accessible at all times.  I don't want the audience to have to search for it at any point.
**One page or multiple pages -** Originally I wanted a multipage website but was quickly turned off the idea because it conflicted with my **KISS** principle.  Therefore I opted for the single page.

Originally I wanted to have a parallax effect with my own graphics but then realised I didn't have the time to invest in creating my own artwork as well as learning how to code the website.

# DEVELOPMENT

With the strong foundation and references I had gained during my learning week, the development of the code was fairly straight forward.

I had alot of issues trying to create a contact form because I didnt want to use pre-built code.  After alot of trial and error I didnt have the time to learn and understand PHP enough to create my own code so I utilised Formspree's contact form services to give the desired effect.

# WHAT I WILL DO DIFFERENTLY ON MY NEXT WEBSITE?

* I will allocate more time to the design and content of my website.  I am happy with the coding aspect of my website but feel that the design could be improved with more time invested.
* Use a framework such as bootstrap to cut down on the coding aspect of the project.
* Create my own artwork for the full page to develop my design skills further and showcase them.
